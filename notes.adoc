I've added the list function today.
+
I've been struggling with the list template -- it didn't see the `visitors` slice that I was passing.
The reason was that you should add the dot when calling a nested template.
In my case the `bootstrap` template calls the `content` template.
If you want to process any data in the `content` template you should call it like this: 
`{{template "content" . }}`.
More than that, in my case the `bootstrap` template first defines itself (`{{define "bootstrap"}}`)
and then, at the end of the template, it calls itself: `{{template "bootstrap"}}`.
In this last call you should also pass the dot and use it `{{template "bootstrap" . }}`.

After I decided not to use any framework (like Gorilla in the original implamentation based 
of the book by Jon Calhoun) I found myself struggling with the problem of filling the 
data structure from the Web form. 
In Gorilla is is solved by using the `schema` package.
I decided to explore this problem and solve it myself.
The way to solve it is to use _tags_ in the struct.
But to parse them properly you have to use the `reflect` package.
I heard that it's not considered a good practice, but it didn't look like there are other ways.
+
After reading Rob Pike's article (https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) I was
brave enough to implement something myself.
+
I ended up with using the tag `form` (instead of `schema`) and implementing 
what I have learned from the article. 
Here is the Gist: https://gist.github.com/pavelanni/5021927367867dc31ce0b464fa5364c1
It's far from elegant, and most likely not how it should be implemented,
but at least I tried ;-) 
+
I ended up using `gorilla/schema` -- it's more convenient than recreating this from scratch.
But it was a good practice anyway.
